In p?q the variables in q are not free.

Do we need channels to change initially? 

FV (p?q) = []

At the top level then:

FV (p!q) = [q]  # don't let q be ree at the momemt.

FV (p+q) = [p,q]

FV (p.q)                                # SEQ Binds.
                                        # Need to get binding variables.
Binding variables

What happens if you combine two squences?
## Possible take I as glue?
## I is never used alone.

p.I.q.I - p.q.I

Then:

p1.I.p2.I.q.I binding variables in p1 and p2 bind q, reduces to:

p1.p2.q.I

BV (I) = []
BV (p.q) = 
BV (p+q) = BV(p) + BV(q)
BV (p?q.I) = [q]
BV (p?q1.p?q2.I) = [q1,q2]
BV (p!q) = []
